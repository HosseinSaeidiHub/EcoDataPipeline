# EcoDataPipeline
# ðŸ”„ Scalable ETL Pipelines for Economic Research

This project provides robust, modular, and scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines designed to gather, clean, and process large-scale datasets for empirical economic analysis and macroeconomic modeling.

Built with data quality, reproducibility, and performance in mind, the pipelines automate ingestion from various APIs and raw sources (CSV, Excel, SQL), apply rigorous validation and transformation rules, and export clean datasets for downstream analysis or modeling.

## ðŸ“Š Use Cases

- Collecting macroeconomic indicators from online databases (e.g. World Bank, IMF, FRED)
- Cleaning messy multi-source financial or economic panel data
- Merging datasets by time, country, sector, or firm-level identifiers
- Building research-ready datasets for DSGE calibration or ML models
